# Network Security Labs  

Practical network security labs focused on **reconnaissance, scanning, protocol enumeration, and exploitation techniques**.  
This repository contains **walkthroughs, notes, and exploitation reports** from the Network Security learning path.  

---

## Labs Covered  
- Passive Reconnaissance  
- Active Reconnaissance  
- Nmap Live Host Discovery  
- Nmap Basic Port Scans  
- Nmap Advanced Port Scans  
- Nmap Post Port Scans  
- Protocols and Servers (1 & 2)  
- Net Sec Challenge  

---

## Prerequisites  
These labs primarily use:  
- **Nmap** – scanning, host discovery, and service enumeration  
- **Whois / Dig / Nslookup** – passive reconnaissance tools  
- **Traceroute / Ping / Telnet / Netcat** – active reconnaissance and protocol testing  
- **Wireshark** – packet capture and protocol analysis  
- **Common protocol clients** (FTP, SSH, SMTP, etc.)  

---

## Report Format  
Each write-up includes:  
1. **Summary of the Target** – objectives and skills covered.  
2. **Exploitation Steps** – walkthrough of commands, tools, and techniques used.  
3. **Findings with Screenshots** – proof of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or results.  
4. **Remediation Advice** – how to mitigate or fix the issue.
