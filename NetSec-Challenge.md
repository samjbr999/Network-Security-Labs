# Lab Report: Net Sec Challenge

## Summary of the Target
This is the **capstone challenge** for the Network Security path, combining passive recon, active recon, and Nmap scanning into a practical scenario.

## Exploitation Steps
1. Collected initial information with **whois** and **nslookup**.  
2. Used **ping & traceroute** for active host discovery.  
3. Conducted **Nmap scans** to enumerate services.  
4. Compiled all findings into a structured attack surface map.  

## Findings with Screenshots
- Discovered multiple open services.  
- Confirmed internal routing paths.  
- Validated service versions and vulnerabilities.

## Remediation Advice
- Apply **defense-in-depth** (firewalls, IDS, segmentation).  
- Regularly audit services with vulnerability scans.  
- Ensure least privilege access across exposed services.
