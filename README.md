# Network Security Labs  

This repository contains **walkthroughs, notes, and exploitation reports** from the **Network Security** learning path.  
The focus is on **network reconnaissance, Nmap scanning, and protocol analysis**, with hands-on examples and screenshots.  

---

## Labs Covered  

1. **Passive Reconnaissance**  
   - Using tools like `whois`, `nslookup`, `dig`, and search engines to gather intelligence without touching the target.  

2. **Active Reconnaissance**  
   - Leveraging tools like `traceroute`, `ping`, `telnet`, and web browsers to actively interact with targets.  

3. **Nmap Basic Port Scans**  
   - Performing TCP connect, SYN, and UDP scans to identify open ports and services.  

4. **Nmap Advanced Port Scans**  
   - Using stealth techniques such as FIN, XMAS, NULL, and idle scans; bypassing firewalls and intrusion detection systems.  

5. **Protocols & Servers**  
   - Understanding common protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, IMAP) and identifying their vulnerabilities in practice.

## Report Format  

Each lab write-up includes:  
1. **Summary of the Target** – Short description of the lab and objectives.  
2. **Exploitation Steps** – Walkthrough of tools, commands, and techniques used.  
3. **Findings with Screenshots** – Proof of vulnerabilities or reconnaissance results.  
4. **Remediation Advice** – Guidance to secure and mitigate issues.
