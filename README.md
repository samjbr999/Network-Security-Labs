# Network Security Labs

This repository contains **walkthroughs, notes, and exploitation reports** from the **Network Security** learning path.  
The focus is on **network reconnaissance, Nmap scanning, and protocol analysis**, with hands-on examples and screenshots.

---

## Labs Covered
- **Passive Reconnaissance**  
  Using tools like `whois`, `nslookup`, `dig`, and search engines to gather intelligence without touching the target.  

- **Active Reconnaissance**  
  Leveraging tools like `traceroute`, `ping`, `telnet`, and web browsers to actively interact with targets.  

- **Nmap Basic Port Scans**  
  Performing TCP Connect, SYN, and UDP scans to identify open ports and services.  

- **Nmap Advanced Port Scans**  
  Using stealth techniques (FIN, XMAS, NULL, Idle scans) to bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems.  

- **Net Sec Challenge**  
  Applying reconnaissance and scanning techniques in a real-world style lab challenge.

## Report Format
Each lab write-up includes:

1. **Summary of the Target** – Short description of the lab and objectives.  
2. **Exploitation Steps** – Walkthrough of tools, commands, and techniques used.  
3. **Findings with Screenshots** – Proof of reconnaissance results or vulnerabilities.  
4. **Remediation Advice** – Guidance to secure and mitigate issues.
